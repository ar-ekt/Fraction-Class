This class supports fraction in python.

You can make an object of this class in four way;
1. Frac(int, int): first integer is numerator and the second is denominator of fraction
2. Frac(int): given integer is numerator and denominator will be 1
3. Frac(float): float will be converted to a fraction that its denominator is power of ten
4. Frac(str): format of given string must be "int/int". integer before slash is numerator and the integer after slash is denominator of fraction

Supports math operations;
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Floor-division (//)
6. Power (**)
7. Reminder (%)

Supports comparison operators;
1. Equal (==)
2. Not equal (!=)
3. Greater (>)
4. Less (<)
5. Greater or equal (>=)
6. Less or equal (<=)

Supports abs, floor, ceil, round and trunc functions
Frac's objects can be converted to int, float and str

Simplify function: return a new fraction that its numerator and denominator have simplified
Reverse function: return a new fraction that place of its numerator and denominator have changed
